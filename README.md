The word embeddings are visualized using [Tensorflow Projector](projector.tensorflow.org)
Got to projector.tensorflow.org and upload the vector and meta files either the ones found in this repo or those generated by your model.
For a better visualization of the polarity of the embeddings check the 'spherize data' checkbox
